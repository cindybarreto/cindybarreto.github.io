## About Me
| <img src="images/headshot.png" alt="Cindy Barreto - PhD Student in EEB"> |I am a PhD student in the [Rubega Lab](https://rubegalab.uconn.edu/), at the [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department](https://eeb.uconn.edu/), [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/).
  
My research project is about conservation genomics of Roseate terns, a federally endangered species that reproduces in the Northwest Atlantic and winters in South America. I am also interested in: Animal behavior; Bird anatomy and physiology; Conservation Biology; Ecosystems ecology; Ecotoxicology; Environmental
health; Environmental management strategies; Environmental risks for biodiversity richness; Evolution; Genomics; Migration
and Movement tracking.

I did my master's degree in Biology of Freshwater Ecosystems at [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande](https://www.furg.br/), Brazil, with an exchange period at [University of Saskatchewan](https://www.usask.ca/), Canada, with a fellowship from the Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program (ELAP).

I have a Licentiate degree in Biological Sciences from [Universidade Federal de Pelotas](https://portal.ufpel.edu.br/en/) and a Bachelor in Environmental Management from [Instituto Federal Sul-rio-grandense](http://www.ifsul.edu.br/), Brazil.
